# MATLAB RAG Project - Personal Reflections

## What I Learned

- First hands-on experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Understanding of vector embeddings and similarity search
- How to integrate multiple AI components: embeddings, vector stores, and LLMs
- Practical experience with HuggingFace transformers and model quantization
- Document processing and chunking strategies for technical documentation

## Challenges Encountered

- **Memory Management**: Large models required careful memory optimization with BitsandBytes quantization
- **PDF Processing**: MATLAB documentation had complex formatting that needed preprocessing
- **Context Length**: Balancing chunk size vs. context preservation in document splitting
- **Model Selection**: Finding the right balance between model capability and computational resources

## Technical Decisions

- **ChromaDB**: Chosen for its simplicity and Python integration over more complex solutions
- **PyMuPDF**: Selected for robust PDF text extraction capabilities
- **LangChain**: Provided excellent abstractions for RAG pipeline construction
- **Quantization**: 4-bit quantization provided good performance/quality trade-off

## Areas for Future Improvement

- Implement semantic chunking instead of fixed-size chunks
- Add query expansion and refinement capabilities
- Experiment with different embedding models for technical documentation
- Add evaluation metrics for retrieval quality and answer relevance
- Consider hybrid search combining semantic and keyword search

## Key Insights

- RAG quality heavily depends on document preprocessing and chunking strategy
- Vector similarity doesn't always capture semantic relevance for technical queries
- Model quantization is crucial for running larger models on consumer hardware
- Proper evaluation frameworks are essential for iterative improvement

## Code Examples

Here's how I implemented the quantization:

```python
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig
import torch

# Configure 4-bit quantization
bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)
```

This approach reduced memory usage by ~75% while maintaining reasonable performance for the RAG system.
